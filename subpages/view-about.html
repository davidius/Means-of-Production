	<h1>About</h1>
	<p><em>Means of Production</em> was born out of an overwhelming sense of despair (yes, despair) with the state of productivity apps. Some allowed you to create to-do lists; some allowed you to do pomodoros; some allowed you to set reminders; and some allowed you to track your productivity (albeit not meaningfully). But none could do <em>all</em> of these things. Worse yet, none actually made you more productive. </p>

	<p>The goal of <em>Means of Production</em> is to remedy all these ailments by being the only truly all-in-one productivity app, and to do it all for free. It's very much a work in progress, and there are many features on the way. If you would like to suggest ideas or improvements, please email me at <a href="mailto:david@meansapp.com?subject=I%20have%20some%20suggestions,%20David" target="_blank">david@meansapp.com</a>.</p>

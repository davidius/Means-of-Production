# Means-of-Production
While some productivity apps allow you to create to-do lists, some to do pomodoros, some to set reminders, and some to track your productivity (albeit not meaningfully), none can do all of these things. Worse yet, none actually make you more productive. _Means of Production_ is an attempt to create a truly all-in-one productivity app. Ultimately, I intend it to be a one-stop shop that minimises the need to use multiple apps in your workflow, as everything you'll need can be done here.

## Features
- Do pomodoros
- Set daily goals for each project, either in time or units of your choice
- Keep track of your productivity
- Keep to-do lists
- Get email reminders
- Keep a log
